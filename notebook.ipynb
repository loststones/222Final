    "we also dropped columns such as the name of song and the miliseconds played. In adition, because the stock market only opporates on weekdays, we had to make the df only contain weekday dates(Mon-Fri). We also had to drop the dates of holidays because the stock market is closed on those days as well.\n",

    "We were trying to use an API that gave data on the stock market, but the API's we found had a limited number of request that we could use. Becuase the spotify data is so extensive, we had to branch away from using the API and instead made a csv file that contained stock information."
