    "We were trying to use an API that gave data on the stock market, but the API's we found had a limited number of request that we could use. Becuase the spotify data is so extensive, we had to branch away from using the API and instead made a csv file that contained stock information. One of the biggest problem when preparing the data was trying to get the dates from the spotify data to match with the dates for our stock market data. As many of you are probably aware, the stock market does not opperate on the weekends or on holidays, so when trying to compare dates, we had to drop those dates from the spotify data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this we used a csv file that gave the days of week with the date."
